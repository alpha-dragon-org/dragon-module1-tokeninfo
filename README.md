# Intro to Dragon's Modules

Dragon is a companion that visualizes the concentrations in power for any token on the Solana blockchain. The extension is separated into modules that provide different analyses on a token. Soon, developers will contribute their own modules to Dragon based on what they think is important for traders to know in the trenches. 

The initial release includes four modules and the module for this bounty is:

**1. Token Info**
- This module displays a basic overview on token information like ticker, age, market cap, and number of holders. It also displays fundamental security measures such as if the mint authority is revoked, freeze authority revoked, and if the liquidity pool is locked. See all details about the data to fetch for this module [below](#module-details).

## Contribution Overview

This module currently gathers data by web-scraping TrenchyBot and a few other sources. The task is to build a pipeline that connects this module to a Solana RPC (eg. [Helius](https://www.helius.dev)) and replace all scrapes if possible. If any data can not be retrieved from RPC, the developer can use whatever means necessary given the goals stated in the [Module Details](#module-details) below.

If the data retrieved is as close to real-time as possible, Dragon becomes an unbeatable companion in the trenches.

## Integrating RPCs for Data Retrieval

[Helius](https://www.helius.dev) is an example of an RPC service that enables quick and direct access to on-chain data on Solana. By integrating RPCs into Dragon's modules, we can **replace slow web-scraping techniques** and **increase data accuracy.** 

**How to update the code (with Helius)**
- **Modify the stub functions:** In files like `src/modules/tokenInfo.js` and `src/api/server.js`, update the stub implementations to call the appropriate Helius RPC endpoints.
- **Leverage the configured endpoints:** Use the `HELIUS_RPC_URL` from `src/config/config.js` to ensure that your RPC calls are directed to the correct endpoint with your API key.
- **Improve performance:** Integrate batching of RPC calls if necessary to further improve response time.

*Note:* If any data can not be retrieved from RPC, or if data can be faster retrieved via another method such as data streams, the developer can implement the alternative method with a brief explanation for their choice.

## Future Bounties

Dragon’s aim is to make token analyses more transparent and community-driven. At the community's direction, bounties will expand to include all kinds of fundamental token analyses.

If you have an idea for a module that could benefit traders in the trenches, please propose it in the discussion [here](https://github.com/orgs/alpha-dragon-org/discussions) to be considered for a bounty.
